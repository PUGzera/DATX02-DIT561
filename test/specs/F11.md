## Description

### Requirement: 
R8

### Purpose:
The purpose of the test is to verify that IO expressions are accepted at the prompt.

## Preconditions
None

## Test steps
Use `print`, or any other function that returns an `IO` expression, at the prompt.

## Expected result

If `print` is used, the argument should be printed to the console if it has a `Show` instance. In particular, strings should be surrounded with double-quotes: `print "test"` should print `"test"` rather than `test`.

If a different function is used, it should work as expected.
