## Description

### Requirement: 
R2 & R3

### Purpose:
The purpose of the test is to verify that itâ€™s possible to write queries at the prompt and that a transaction is started automatically.

## Preconditions
A database connection should be open and a table should be created.

### Table definition example

```haskell
data People = People { name :: String, age :: Int } deriving Data

let (people, people_name, people_age) = (table "people" `withIndex` people_name `withIndex` people_age :: Table People, index people "name" name :: Index People String, index people "age" age :: Index People Int)
```

## Test steps

1. Execute Daison queries

### Example Daison queries:
```haskell
tryCreateTable people

insert people (return (People "Alice" 23))
insert people (return (People "Bob" 25))

select [name x | x <- from people (at 1)]
```

## Expected result

The Daison queries should be executed successfully.
Example queries should yield result `["Alice"]`.
