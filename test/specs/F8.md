## Description

### Requirement: 
R6 & R7

### Purpose:
The purpose of the test is to verify that non-small query results are displayed to the user as a formatted, navigable table. 

## Preconditions
- GHC version == 8.10.3
- A Daison database with at least one table containing at least two entries, and a table with at least 20 rows where at least one row contains data whose character length exceeds the width of the terminal.
- A terminal that supports the command “echo string | less”, i.e. supports the programs echo and less, as well as the pipe symbol | to transfer the output of echo to less. 

## Test steps
1. Load an existing database and enter the query  “select [x | x <- from TABLE everything]”, where TABLE is a table with at least two entries.
2. Verify that it is formatted in a table with three columns.
3. Now enter the query “select [snd x | x <- from TABLE everything]”
4. Verify that it is formatted in a table with an appropriate number of columns.
5. If the table is larger than the terminal window in both horizontal and vertical directions, verify that the arrow keys can be used to navigate in all cardinal directions.
6. If the table is not large enough, open another, larger one or add new (large) entries, then repeat step 5.
7. Add an entry to the table if this was not already done in step 6.
8. Verify that the output was printed directly to the console rather than as a formatted table.


## Expected result

The table in step 1 should have three columns: element index, key, data.

The table in step 3 should have a number of columns equal to 1 + the number of elements in the top-level tuple as shown in the type signature for *it*, and two columns if *it* is not a list of tuples.

Below are examples of the correct number of columns given the type signature for *it*:
 - `[(String, String, Float, Bool)]` => 5 columns
 - `[String]` => 2 columns
 - `[(String)]` => 2 columns
 - `[(Int, (Int, Float, Bool))]` => 3 columns
 - `[Maybe (Int, Int, Int)]` => 2 columns

Large tables should be navigable using the arrow keys.

Queries that produce small output (e.g. insert, delete, create/dropTable) should be printed directly to the terminal, unformatted. The output for insert and delete should be a list of Keys.
