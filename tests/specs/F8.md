## Description

### Requirements:
R6 & R7

### Purpose:
The purpose of the test is to verify that non-small query results are displayed to the user as a formatted, navigable table.

## Preconditions
- [*test.db*](data/test.db) and [*TestDefs.hs*](data/TestDefs.hs)
- A terminal that supports the command `echo string | less`, i.e. supports the programs *echo* and *less*, as well as the pipe symbol `|` to transfer the output of *echo* to *less*.

## Test steps
1. Load the test database and its table definitions.
2. Enter the query `select [x | x <- from TABLE everything]` for any table in *TestDefs* **except for** `emptyTuple` and `empty`.
3. Verify that it is formatted in a table with three columns.
4. Enter the query `select [snd x | x <- from TABLE everything]` for the tables `either3I`, `emptyTuples`, `ssfb`, `tupleInTuple` and `listOfNumbers`.
5. Verify that output from all queries are formatted in tables with appropriate numbers of columns.
6. Enter the query `select [snd x | x <- from TABLE everything]` for the table `numbers`.
7. Verify that the arrow keys can be used to navigate in all cardinal directions.
8. Enter the query `select [snd x | x <- from TABLE everything]` for the tables empty and emptyTuple.
9. Insert a value into any table, and then remove it.
10. Verify that the outputs in steps 8 and 9 were printed directly to the terminal rather than as a formatted table.


## Expected result

The table in step 2 should have three columns: element index, key, data.

The tables in step 4 should have numbers of columns equal to 1 + the number of elements in the top-level tuple as shown in the type signature for it, and two columns if `it` is not a list of tuples.

Below are examples of the correct number of columns given the type signature for `it`:
 - `[(String, String, Float, Bool)]` => 5 columns
 - `[String]` => 2 columns
 - `[[Bool]]` => 2 columns
 - `[(Int, (Int, Float, Bool))]` => 3 columns
 - `[Maybe (Int, Int, Int)]` => 2 columns

Large tables should be navigable using the arrow keys.

Queries that produce small output (e.g. `insert`, `delete`, `create/dropTable`, `select` on a table that outputs at most one small row) should be printed directly to the terminal, unformatted (i.e. not as a table). The output for `insert` should be a 2-tuple of `Key`s and the output for a successful `delete` should be a list containing a single `Key`.
