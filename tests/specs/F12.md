## Description

### Requirement:
R12

### Purpose:
The purpose of the test is to verify that databases can be opened and closed. Databases should also be possible to supply as an argument to the program which should then be set on start-up.

## Preconditions

None

## Test steps

1. Start the program with multiple databases as arguments
2. Check the list of open databases with `:dbs`
3. Close the currently active database (marked at the prompt message)
4. Open a new database
5. Check the list of open databases again

### Example commands
```console
foo@bar:~$ daison-frontend firstDb.db secondDb.db
Daison (secondDb.db)> :dbs
Daison (secondDb.db)> :close secondDb.db
Daison (firstDb.db)> :open thirdDb.db
Daison (thirdDb.db)> :dbs
```
## Expected result

1. Upon launching the program it should respond that the arguments have been handled
2. It should print the supplied database arguments
3. The active database should be closed and the second-last database argument should be set to the active
4. The active database should be set to `thirdDb.db`
5. It should print the open databases, the one that was closed in step 3 should not be in the list
