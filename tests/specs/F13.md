## Description

### Requirement:
R10

### Purpose:

The purpose of the test is to verify that it is possible to load Haskell files at startup

## Preconditions
There should be a Haskell file with at least one function. For example:

```haskell
module F13Example(
    exampleFunction
) where

exampleFunction :: Int -> Int -> Int
exampleFunction a b = a*b
```

## Test steps

1. Supply the path to a Haskell file at startup as an argument
2. Verify that the file is loaded properly by calling its functions

### Example commands
```console
foo@bar:~$ daison-frontend F13Example.hs
Daison> exampleFunction 3 5
```

## Expected result

The file should be loaded successfully.

Example commands should result in 15 being printed.
